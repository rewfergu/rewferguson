I imagined that if I could find a way to modify the Raspberry Pi camera module and fit it inside the case, there would be enough room inside the film compartment for the rest of the Raspberry Pi’s electronics. I’d have a Raspberry Pi powered camera inside a cool vintage super 8 case."

I’d like some ambient light provided with RGB LEDs that change their color temperature based on the local weather outside. I’m sure there are lamps that do this, but I would like the light more integrated into my work area. Not one single spot of colored light, but an overall ambient glow. I figure to get this effect I would have to build something myself."
