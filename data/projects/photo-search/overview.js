    Now that I have a family, I thought it would be a great idea to put more family photos around. As I was collecting photos, I realized I don't know a lot about the poeple in some of these older ones, and as the years march on it's possible I could find myself in a situation where I dont have access to this information. So it's not just a matter of saving photos, but saving as much of the story as I can as well.

    Since I am a web developer, my first idea was to create a web project, and I wanted a way to search the photo database using only the photo as a query parameter. By storing the photos in a searchable database, I can use a mobile snapshot of the framed picture on the wall to search for info about it. That photo goes to my server where it uses a matching algorithm to match the photo request and provide any relavant info from the database.
