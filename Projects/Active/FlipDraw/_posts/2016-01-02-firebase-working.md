{%include figure.html src="/img/flipDraw/stroke.gif" alt="stroke being animated to screen" caption="SVG path data being transmitted through firebase." %}

Using Paper.js I can send the svg path data from one phone to another over firebase in real time. Paper translates the svg data into pixel data printed to the canvas.
