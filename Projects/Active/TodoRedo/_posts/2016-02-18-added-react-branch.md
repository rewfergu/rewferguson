![react ui](/img/TodoRedo/react-ui.png)

I wasn't happy with the UI I had built in Angular or Angular + Ionic, so I started again using react this time. I never really liked using animations in angular and I didn't want to keep messing with the old version anyway so starting over didn't seem any worse than any of the other options.  

I started down the PouchDB road, but eventually I did think storing the data in a database was a good idea, and I already had the firebase thing setup so I went back to that. Adding the login back in is never super fun to me, but I got the basics in without that much trouble.

I still don't have any animations yet, but based on some CodePen test I think I can do it with a bit more flexibility. And I'm starting to get the swing of setting up and nesting react components.
