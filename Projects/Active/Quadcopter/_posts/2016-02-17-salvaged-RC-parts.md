I was able to salvage the transmitter, receiver, motor, speed controller, and servos from an old RC plane I found.  Still works. The whole setup is actually much simpler than I imagined.

It does need lots of batteries, which I don't have, so I just pulled a couple AC adapters out of my AC adapter graveyard and wired the transmitter and receiver directly to them. The receiver worked with 5 volts and the transmitter with 12.
