[Drawing game example on Codepen.][1]

I used Processing.js to get a quick drawing example up.  One side is SVG, and the other side is canvas.  The buttons on the top left change the brush size.  jQuery is used (at the time of this writing) for the button interactions and to resize the canvas on window resize.
