I needed a stand so I could read my iPad easily while sitting at my desk. The amount of junk accessories for mobile devices these days is a bit overwhelming, so after a few minutes of searching I decided to just make one out of a couple pieces of wood. The design is actually really functional. It was inexpensive, folds up almost completely flat, and takes up no space in my bag. Getting the notch cut right took a couple of tries, but overall more rewarding than buying something ready-made.
