## Raspberry Pi + Bluetooth Keyboard & Monitor

I can use bluetooth and hdmi on the Pi itself for running commands and monitoring video.  The iPhone hotspot would be a convenient way to get files in and out.  I could send files to the MacBook for editing using the iPhone as a portable, battery powered router.

## Raspberry Pi + iPad

If I was using the iPhone anyway for a router, I could SSH into the Pi using the phone itself, or if the screen was too small I could take advantage of the iPads larger screen.  Previewing video on the mobile device would be pretty cool but might be slow.
