This is a simple experiment to communicate with servos over a node server.  Node is running an express server with a react ui, communication is then sent back to the server in real time using socket.io, then those instructions are sent to the servos using the Johnny Five framework.

You can use the UI slider to send a message to the servo. The range is 0 to 180 to reflect the degrees of the servos motion.
