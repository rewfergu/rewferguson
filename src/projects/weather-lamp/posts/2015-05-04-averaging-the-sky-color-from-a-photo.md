In processing I can grab an image of the sky from one of the webcams around Austin and load the pixels in to an array.

Its then easy to average out the sky pixels to get one rgb value.

This doesn&#8217;t really make a pleasing lamp though.  The color temperature is just way too blue.  I&#8217;ll have to find another way of turning an image of the sky into a pleasing lamp color.
