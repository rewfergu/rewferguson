I started thinking about using PouchDB and just using local storage for the todo list data. It works, but not great and there may still be an easier way.

PouchDB is an offline first data storage library built on CouchDB. The idea is that the data is managed offline and then synced online when you have a connection. To use offline only, just don't sync the data.
