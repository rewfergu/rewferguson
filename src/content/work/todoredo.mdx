A simple todo list built in React and Firebase. I’ve never made one, so I wanted to try one as a test. The only aspect of this app that I haven’t seen anywhere else is I wanted a daily list that would reset itself each day. I have items that I would like to check off each day, and the next morning be presented with a fresh list.
