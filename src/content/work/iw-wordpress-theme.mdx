Many of ACCs department sites and instructional projects were based
in WordPress. Instructional Web needed to develop a base theme so that these projects
would benefit from a similar visual language and more closely follow college branding
and standards. We developed a series of customizable content blocks in Advanced
Custom Fields that could then be reassembled in the admin to give content owners
some control over the presentation and still be within a standard accessible theme.
