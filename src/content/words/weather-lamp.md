I picked an office with no windows, so I’m stuck with artificial light only while I work. I’d like some ambient light provided with RGB LEDs that change their color temperature based on the local weather outside. I’m sure there are lamps that do this, but I would like the light more integrated into my work area. Not one single spot of colored light, but an overall ambient glow. I figure to get this effect I would have to build something myself.
